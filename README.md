# The Thirscript Programming Language

A dynamically-typed prototype-based language with the additional design goal of having a simple grammar.

Its original versions were intended as a scripting language for a small game. The game is no longer being developed now, but I'm continuing the language for fun. Don't ask what the name means - it's literally just a random syllable I had in my head, and I don't know what I'd rename it to.
